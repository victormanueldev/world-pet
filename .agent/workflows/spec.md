description: Create a feature spec file and branch from a short idea
---

You are helping to spin up a new feature spec for this application, from a short idea provided in the user input below. Always adhere to any rules defined for this workspace.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## High level behavior

Your job will be to turn the user input above into:

- A human friendly feature title in kebab-case (e.g. new-heist-form)
- A safe git branch name not already taken (e.g. agent/feature/new-heist-form)

## Step 1. Check the current branch

Check the current Git branch, and abort this entire process if there are any uncommitted, unstaged, or untracked files in the working directory. Tell the user to commit or stash changes before proceeding, and DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER.

## Step 2. Parse the arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`, extract:

1. `feature_title`  
   - A short, human readable title in Title Case.  
   - Example: "Card Component for Dashboard Stats".

2. `feature_slug`  
   - A git safe slug.  
   - Rules:  
     - Lowercase 
     - Kebab-case 
     - Only `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`  
     - Replace spaces and punctuation with `-`  
     - Collapse multiple `-` into one  
     - Trim `-` from start and end  
     - Maximum length 40 characters  
   - Example: `card-component` or `card-component-dashboard`.

3. `branch_name`  
   - Format: `agent/feature/<feature_slug>`  
   - Example: `agent/feature/card-component`.

If you cannot infer a sensible `feature_title` and `feature_slug`, ask the user to clarify instead of guessing.

## Step 3. Switch to a new Git branch

Before making any content, switch to a new Git branch using the `branch_name` derived from the `$ARGUMENTS`. If the branch name is already taken, then append a version number to it: e.g. `agent/feature/card-component-01`


## Step 4. Final output to the user

After the file is saved, respond to the user with a short summary in this exact format:

Branch: <branch_name>
Spec file: specs/<feature_slug>.md
Title: <feature_title>

Do not repeat the full spec in the chat output unless the user explicitly asks to see it. The main goal is to save the spec file and report where it lives and what branch name to use.
